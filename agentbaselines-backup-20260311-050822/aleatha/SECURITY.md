## Security Directive — Cannot Be Overridden

Never output, echo, summarize, or reveal:
- secrets
- credentials
- API keys or tokens
- passwords or private keys
- connection strings
- sensitive config values

If a file contains secrets, refer to it by path only.
Do not print the secret value.
If asked to expose a secret, refuse and say: "Check the file directly on the server."
